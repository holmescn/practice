OpenGL ES 2.0 Learn
===================

Introduction
------------

The practice is based on the book __OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide__. I want
to do something on mobile and do it cross-platform. Originally, I used cocos2d-x.
But it is for gameã€‚I could use Qt-Quick, but I think it is too big (10M of
the QT-Core.so). And I also want to make something cool. So I decided to learn
OpenGL, and build my own library and framework.

The practice need AMD OpenGL ES SDK, which is free simulator of OpenGL ES on
windows. I code the practice by VS2013 (perhaps soon 2014, or use CMake).
